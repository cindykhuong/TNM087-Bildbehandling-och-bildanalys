%% Syntax of the function
%      Input arguments:
%           f: the original input grayscale image of type double scaled
%               between 0 and 1
%           D0: The cutoff frequency of the Gaussian lowpass filter
%
%      Output arguments:
%           olp: the result after lowpass filtering the input image by
%                the Gaussian lowpass filter
%           ohp: the result after highpass filtering the input image by
%                the Gaussian highpass filter

%% Basic version control (in case you need more than one attempt)

%
%% General rules
%
% 1) Don't change the structure of the template by removing %% lines
%
% 2) Document what you are doing using comments
%
% 3) Before submitting make the code readable by using automatic indentation
%       ctrl-a / ctrl-i
%
% 4) Often you must do something else between the given commands in the
%       template
%
%% Here starts your code.
% Write the appropriate MATLAB commands right after each comment below.
%
%% zero pad the input image
% The input image is zero padded to an image of size P x Q, where P = 2M and
% Q = 2N (M x N is the size of the input image). Notice that the input
% image has to be placed at the top-left corner of the zero-padded image.

[M,N]=size(f);
P = 2*M;
Q = 2*N;

fp = zeros(P,Q); % the zero padded image
fp(1:M,1:N) = f;
    
%% construct the Gaussian lowpass filter transfer function
% If you want, you can write a separate function to construct the Gaussian filter.
% If you do so, don't forget to submit that MATLAB function as well.
%
% The transfer function is supposed to be the same size as the padded image
% that is P x Q
% The cutoff frequency of this filter, D0, is the second input argument of
% this MATLAB function
[X, Y] = meshgrid(0:P-1,0:Q-1);
X = X';
Y = Y';
r = sqrt((X-P/2).^2 + (Y-Q/2).^2); %F� 3&4 s.33

GLPF = exp(-(r.^2)./(2*D0.^2)); % the Gaussian lowpass filter transfer function
    
%% Perform filtering in the frequency domain
% Find the product between the filter transfer function and the Fourier
% transform of the padded image (Notice that the zero frequency is supposed
% to be shifted to the center of the Fourier transform)
FT = fft2(fp);
product = fftshift(FT);

OLP= GLPF.*product; % The Fourier transform of the lowpass filtered image
    
%% Find the padded lowpass filtered image
% The zero frequency of OLP should be shifted back to the top left corner of the
% image followed by the inverse Fourier transform. Take the real part of
% the result.

%ifft2: inverse transform
%ifftshift: shift back OLP to the top left corner

olpf= real(ifft2(ifftshift(OLP))); % The padded lowpass filtered image of size P x Q
    
%% Find the lowpass filtered image
% Extract the final lowpass filtered image from the padded lowpass filtered
% image

olp = olpf(1:M, 1:N); % The final lowpass filtered image 
    
%% Find the final highpass filtered image
% Read the document for this task

%Seeing the difference, the difference between the first and the second row

ohp = f-olp; % The final highpass filtered image
    
%% Test your code
%
% Test your code on different images (for example Einstein1.jpg,
% Einstein2.jpg or characterTestPattern.tif) using different cutoff
% frequencies and look at the result of lowpass filtering and highpass
% filtering the original image. Ask yourself, what happens if you increase
% the cutoff frequency (the second input argument of your function). Will the
% result be blurrier or less blurry? Test it and see whether or not you are
% correct. Hopefully, you are not surprised by the result, if you are,
% discuss it with your classmates or the teachers.
